<h1><font size="3"> This project withstood a lot of brainstorming, in order to introduce accurate ideas. <br>
Our team reflected the effects of COVID19 on various solutions that could be brought forward.<br>
We developed ideas of creating some kind of app or website with a database for states and countries <br>
to determine which hospitals need PPE the most amidst the COVID19 pandemic. It is true that the demand <br> 
for PPE is rising drastically as COVID19 it is spreading all over the world today. Hospitals and <br>
individuals need PPE more than they ever did before. So, our projects would start off as a predictive analysis <br>
where a map will be used to facilitate machine learning. It will simply predict where COVID19 is most severe <br>
and will be correlating that with the need for PPE and its distribution. This model will help state <br>
governments and state health agencies to decide where to distribute PPE. Individual hospitals can also <br>
input their need for PPE as we gain more data and use our predictive analysis to become more accurate. <br>
We are lookking forward to forecasting COVID19 severity at different levels - hospital level and country<br>
level. The data to be fed at the hospital level includes the location of the hospital, the number of ICU beds,<br>
the total number of employees, the hospital types and contact information. At the country level, the data includes<br>
socioeconomic factors, social distancing scores, and COVID19 cases/deaths form USA Facts and NYT. <br>

So, who will benefit from this model aand information provided?<br>
Firstly, biotech companies creating testing kits will benefit and see where their kits will be most impactful.<br>
Communities have been running short of medical equipment, including ventilaros and respirators, and basic personal<br>
protective equipment (PPE), like masks gloves, and gowns through this predictive model, every community will have<br>
a fair chance of gaining access to PPE, that is through the state government's 'to-be' predictive model. Individuals<br>
will also be ensured safety, knowing that their community hospitals are in a stable condition to deal with COVID19.<br>
